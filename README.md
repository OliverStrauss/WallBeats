# sticky-wall

A projector and a USB webcam both point at a wall. You stick sticky notes on the
wall and the wall becomes a beat instrument: balls fall from notes in the top
band onto the notes below them, in time, and every hit plays the note's pitch.

Plain HTML/JS, no framework, no build step. OpenCV.js (vision), Web Audio
(sound), `<canvas>` (rendering), `BroadcastChannel` (sync between the two
windows). OpenCV is vendored in `vendor/`, so it runs offline.

## Quick start (macOS)

```sh
cd ARExperiment              # this folder
python3 -m http.server 8000  # python3 ships with macOS
```

1. In **Chrome**, open **http://localhost:8000/control.html** (laptop screen).
2. Click **Open projector window**, drag that window onto the projector and
   press **Fullscreen** (or `F`).
3. Pick your USB webcam in the **Camera** dropdown.
4. **Calibrate**: click the 4 numbered dots in the camera view, then **Done**.
5. Stick a note on the wall and press **Space** to start the clock: a ball
   drops onto it from the top of the wall and climbs back. Stick a second note above it and the
   ball ping-pongs between the two. See *How to play*.

`getUserMedia` needs `localhost` (or https); opening the files with `file://`
will not work. Both windows must come from the same address so they can talk.

**No hardware handy?** Choose **Simulated wall (test, no hardware)** in the
camera dropdown. It fakes a wall with sticky notes seen at an angle and mirrors
the projector's picture onto it, so calibration, detection and the beat all work
exactly as with the real thing. Drag notes around in the camera view.

## One-time Mac setup

| What | How |
|---|---|
| Projector as a second screen | System Settings → Displays → set the projector to **Extend** (not Mirror), native resolution. Leave "Displays have separate Spaces" on (default) so fullscreen on the projector doesn't hide the laptop screen. |
| Browser | Chrome recommended (camera labels, OpenCV WebAssembly speed). |
| Camera permission | System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → enable Chrome. Without it the feed stays black with no error. |
| Keep the screen awake | Run `caffeinate -d` in a terminal while playing. |
| iPhone camera | Continuity Camera can show up in the camera list; pick the USB webcam. |

Keep `control.html` visible on the laptop screen (not minimised or fully
covered): Chrome throttles hidden windows and detection would slow to ~1 Hz.

## Testing with the real hardware (checklist)

Everything below was verified against the simulated wall, but real cameras,
projectors and rooms differ. Go through it stage by stage.

**1. Camera + threshold**
- [ ] The dropdown shows the USB webcam by name (not "Camera 1").
- [ ] Status shows the camera resolution and ~30 fps.
- [ ] Notes are white in the *Threshold mask*, the wall is black. Tune
      **Sat min** first (raise it until the wall disappears), then **Val min**.
      Check again with the projector on, since its light changes colours.
- [ ] Red/pink notes: if they vanish, try *Hue min* > *Hue max* (e.g. 160 → 20):
      that wraps the hue range around red.

**2. Calibration**
- [ ] Calibrate: the projector shows a white border + dots 1-4; click them
      in order (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left). Clicks snap to
      the dot centre; drag a marker to adjust.
- [ ] The blue dashed outline in the feed matches the projected area.
- [ ] Tick **Crosshair test** and move the mouse over the feed: the crosshair
      on the wall should sit under the mouse position everywhere, including the
      corners.
- [ ] Re-calibrate whenever the camera or projector is bumped, or the camera
      resolution changes (the status line warns about that).

**3. Detection**
- [ ] Notes get a green outline with an id in the feed; toggle **Outlines**
      to see faint outlines projected onto the real notes. They should line up.
- [ ] Waving a hand in front of the wall doesn't add or remove notes.
- [ ] Adding a note takes ~1 s to register; removing one ~2 s (see *Tracking*).

**4. Beat**
- [ ] A lone note gets a tag (`E4 · BELL`) and a ball dropping onto it from
      the top of the wall; every hit flashes a halo and plays.
- [ ] A second note straight above it pairs up: the ball ping-pongs and both
      notes play. Moving them apart makes it slower (the rate label at the top
      of the lane changes: 1/8 → 1/4 → 3/8 …).
- [ ] While playing, balls and halos never become notes (watch "Notes: N in
      play"). If they do, raise **Ball mask → Radius multiplier** or
      **Camera lag**.
- [ ] Sound and halos line up. If the sound is late on a Bluetooth speaker,
      use a wired one (Bluetooth adds ~200 ms).

## How to play

The wall is the instrument; the laptop only watches (and keeps loops).

- **Every note gets a ball.** A lone note's ball drops from the top of the
  wall and climbs back. The ruler lines on the wall show the fall time, 1/8
  to 1 bar (*Lone fall per bar* sets the spacing); with Snap on it rounds to
  the nearest line. All balls leave the top on the downbeat, so only notes at
  the same height hit together; lower notes hit later and less often.
- **Pairs ping-pong.** A note below another one that crosses the upper note's
  centre line pairs with it: the ball bounces between them and both play.
  Stacks of 3+ chain into pairs top to bottom.
- **Colour = pitch.** purple C4 · blue D4 · green E4 · yellow G4 · orange A4 ·
  red C5 (pentatonic, so any mix sounds fine).
- **Pair gap = rhythm.** Each *Pair gap per 1/8* of distance between the two
  notes is one more 1/8 note between hits: 2 units apart hits every 1/4 note.
  With **Snap** on (default) gaps round to whole 1/8s; off gives free rhythms.
- **More balls = more hits.** **B** adds a ball to the highlighted lane and
  spreads the lane's balls evenly over its cycle: a lane of quarter notes plays
  8ths with 2 balls, triplets with 3 and 16ths with 4.
- **Instruments.** Click a note on the wall (mouse on the projector window) or
  press **E** for the highlighted lane's target: a ring of instruments appears
  around it. **← →** spin, **↵** or a second click keeps, **Esc** cancels; it
  keeps the choice by itself after 4 s. Or pick it in the Lanes panel.
  bell · pluck · marimba · pad · bass · kick · tom, all at the note's pitch.
  Moving a note keeps its instrument (a note of the same colour placed within
  10 s of one taken down takes over its instrument).
- **Echo + Keep.** The strip at the bottom shows what the wall played in the
  last 4 bars. **K** keeps it as a loop that plays forever, even after you take
  the notes down, so you can build a beat in layers. **Z** undoes the last
  keep, **X** clears them all. Kept notes you take down stay on the wall as
  dashed outlines with dim balls replaying the loop; the outline flashes on
  each hit.

### Keys (either window)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Space | Start / stop the clock |
| [ / ] | Tempo −/+ 2 BPM (hold ⇧ for ±10) |
| S | Snap on / off |
| Tab / ⇧Tab | Highlight next / previous lane (white box around its note, a pair's upper note) |
| B / ⇧B | Add / remove a ball in the highlighted lane |
| A / D | Nudge the highlighted lane left / right |
| E | Instrument ring on the highlighted lane's target |
| ← → ↵ Esc | Ring open: spin / keep / cancel |
| K / X / Z | Keep last 4 bars / clear kept / undo keep |
| 1–6 | Mute a colour (purple … red); ⇧1–6 solos it |
| R | Reset balls (1 per lane, on the downbeat) |
| F | Fullscreen (projector) |
| ? | Show the keys on the wall |

Every key shows a short toast in the top-right corner of the wall.

### control.html

Everything can also be set from the laptop:

| | |
|---|---|
| Top bar | Start/Stop, tempo −/+, Snap, Outlines (faint note outlines on the wall, for debugging) |
| Lanes | One row per lane: target pitch, instrument, rate, balls (−/+), upper note (or lone). Click a row to highlight the lane. Mute / solo buttons per pitch, Reset balls, Keys on wall. |
| Echo | The last bars, one row per pitch (kept hits solid, live hits outlined). Keep / Clear kept / Undo keep. |
| Settings → Beat | Tempo, pair gap per 1/8, lone bounce height, echo bars, max balls per lane. |
| Calibrate, Crosshair test, Freeze notes, Only detect inside the projected area | Setup, as before. |

Sound plays from the **control window** (browsers only allow audio after a
click on the page, so click anywhere there once; the status line shows
`Sound: on`).

**Teach the colours** (recommended with a real camera, since the projector and
webcam shift colours): in *Note colours*, click a colour button, then click
that note in the camera view (inside its yellow outline). Repeat for all six.
The feed labels each note with its colour. *Defaults* forgets taught colours.

## Settings (saved in localStorage)

| Group | Setting | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Beat | Tempo | BPM (also [ ] keys). |
| | Pair gap per 1/8 | Distance between paired notes per 1/8 note between hits (projector heights). Lower it for a small wall. |
| | Lone fall per bar | How far a lone ball falls in one bar (wall heights); spaces the ruler lines. |
| | Echo bars, max balls per lane | Length of the echo / kept loops (4/4 bars); ball limit per lane. |
| HSV threshold | Hue / Sat / Val min & max | OpenCV ranges: H 0-179, S/V 0-255. Saturation is the key one: notes are saturated, the wall and the projected white light are not. |
| Mask cleanup | Morph kernel | Opening removes specks, closing fills holes. |
| | Process width | Frames are downscaled to this width before processing. |
| Note filter | Min / max area | % of the camera frame. |
| | Min rectangularity | blob area / its min-area rectangle; rejects odd shapes. |
| Detection | Rate | Detection runs at this rate (default 3 Hz), not every frame. |
| Tracking | Frames to add / remove | A note must be seen N rounds in a row to be added, and missing M rounds to be removed. |
| | Smoothing, match distance | Corner smoothing; how far a note may move between rounds and still be the same note. |
| Ball mask | Radius multiplier, camera lag | How much area around (and behind) each ball is blanked out before detection. |

```

- **Calibration** (`js/calibration.js`): the 4 clicked camera points and the 4
  known dot positions give a homography via `cv.getPerspectiveTransform`
  (camera px → projector-normalized 0..1) and its inverse. Stored in
  localStorage.
- **Detection** (`js/vision.js`): see the diagram; every temporary `cv.Mat` is
  freed.
- **Tracking** (`js/tracker.js`): nearest-centre matching with add/remove
  hysteresis, corner smoothing and a small deadband. Lanes only ever rebuild
  from tracked notes, so hands and people in front of the wall don't matter.
- **Lanes** (`js/lanes.js`): lone notes and stacked pairs, and the cycle of
  each lane in 16ths.
- **Beat** (`js/beat.js`): musical time is counted in 16ths on a clock that
  re-anchors on tempo changes. A ball is just the phase at which it hits, so
  its position is a formula: no physics. Every 25 ms the scheduler finds the
  hits in the next ~100 ms and schedules them on the `AudioContext` clock
  (`js/sound.js`, `js/instruments.js`). The projector draws the balls from
  the same clock (`performance.timeOrigin + performance.now()` is shared by
  both windows to ~1 ms) and gets each hit ahead of time for its halo.
- **Ball mask**: ball positions are analytic, so the control window knows
  where every ball and halo is and blanks those areas out of the camera
  image before detection. Balls stop a few pixels above the paper and the
  halo mask starts a few pixels outside it, so the mask never cuts into a
  note (which would shrink it, move the mask further in, and eat the note).
- **Messages** are documented in `js/channel.js`. Everything on the wire is in
  projector-normalized coordinates, so any projector resolution works.

## Tests

```sh
node tests/unit.mjs          # tracker, homography, snapping, lanes, beat, echo, ring (Node only)
npm install                  # once: installs playwright for the e2e test
npx playwright install chromium   # once, if no browser is installed
node tests/e2e.mjs           # headless browser run on the simulated wall
```

The end-to-end test calibrates with deliberately sloppy clicks, then checks
the notes it finds against the simulator's ground truth, drags and removes
notes. Then it builds a wall with a pair 2 × unit apart and a lone note,
starts the clock from the projector window and checks the halos arrive every
625 ms at 96 BPM (±8 ms), that **B** doubles the hits, that balls and halos
are never detected as notes, that clicking the target and spinning the ring
sets `kick`, the mute / tempo / help keys, and that a kept layer still plays
after the target is taken down. Screenshots are saved in `tests/out/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Camera list says "Camera 1…" / black feed | Grant camera permission (Mac settings above), then press ↻. |
| "Projector: not connected" | Both windows must be opened from the same `http://localhost:8000`. |
| Notes flicker in/out | Raise *Frames to remove*, lower *Sat min*, raise *Morph kernel*. |
| Wall texture or shadows detected | Raise *Sat min*/*Min area*, keep *Only detect inside the projected area* on. |
| Crosshair is offset | Recalibrate; make sure clicks went 1→2→3→4 clockwise from top-left. |
| Detection is slow (> 100 ms) | Lower *Process width* to 640 or 480. |
| Notes far away aren't picked up (tiny white dots in the mask) | Lower *Min area* (0.01), raise *Process width* (1280), lower *Morph kernel* (3). Also check *Freeze notes* is off. |
| Beige/wood wall shows up in the mask | Narrow *Hue min/max* to your note colour, e.g. green notes 35-85, yellow 20-35, pink 150-175. |
| Two notes don't pair | The lower note must cross the upper note's centre line. Nudge with A / D. |
| Pairs are too slow / the wall is too small | Lower *Pair gap per 1/8*. |
| Arrow keys do nothing | They only spin the instrument ring (click a note or press E first). |
